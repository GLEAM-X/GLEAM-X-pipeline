Singularity build recipes for tooling related to gleam-x

Built with:

sudo singularity build gleamx_tools.img gleamx_build.txt

Once built the container has all software packages required to process GLEAM-X data. 

External data dependencies related to the MWA primary beam are not packed within the container. Doing so would increase the container filesize considerably. 

The container include the 'mwa-reduce' software package, which is only available to the MWA collaboration.
